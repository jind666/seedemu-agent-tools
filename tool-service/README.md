# SEEDemu Agent Tool Service

FastAPI service exposing agent-facing operations for SEED-Emulator.

## Development Setup

From this directory, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install the service and development dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run the Service

```bash
python -m uvicorn seedemu_tool_service.main:app --reload
```

The service is then available at:

- API: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
- OpenAPI documentation: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>
- Health check: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health>
- Runtime backend: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/runtime>
- Tool discovery: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tools>
- Tool invocation: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tools/{name}/invoke>

Invoke a tool by posting its arguments as the request body:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tools/network.inspect_ip_address/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "10.0.0.1"}'
```

Errors use a structured envelope with a machine-readable code:

```json
{"error": {"code": "invalid_arguments", "message": "...", "detail": [...]}}
```

## Run Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Run with Docker Compose

The container connects to the host Docker daemon through `/var/run/docker.sock`. This gives
the tool service control over host containers, images, networks, and volumes. Only run the
service from trusted code and do not expose its API to untrusted networks.

On Linux, set `DOCKER_GID` to the group owner of the Docker socket so the non-root application
user can access it:

```bash
export DOCKER_GID="$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)"
docker compose up --build
```

With Docker Desktop, start the service directly:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Use the runtime endpoint to verify daemon access:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/runtime
```

A healthy response includes `"available": true` and the host Docker daemon version. Stop and
remove the service container with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Tool Domains

Tools are grouped into packages under `seedemu_tool_service/tools/`. Each domain exposes one
registration function that binds its functions or methods to the shared `ToolRegistry`.

The network-domain skeleton is organized as follows:

```text
tools/network/
|-- models.py        # Explicit argument and result models
|-- tools.py         # Tool function or bound-method implementations
`-- registration.py  # Tool metadata and registry bindings
```

The initial network tools are:

- `network.inspect_ip_address`: normalize an IPv4 or IPv6 address and inspect its properties.
- `network.ping`: execute ICMP echo requests inside a selected emulated source container and
  report whether the target host is reachable.

Both demonstrate bound methods, explicit Pydantic argument validation, domain registration,
discovery, and registry invocation. Each registration associates a handler with an argument model.
The registry derives the tool's input JSON Schema from that model, while the result model defines
the stable output contract.

The ping command is passed to Docker as an argument vector rather than through a shell. New network
tools should follow the same pattern and be added to `register_network_tools()`.

### DNS Domain

The DNS-domain skeleton follows the same structure:

```text
tools/dns/
|-- models.py        # DNS argument and result models
|-- tools.py         # DNS tool implementations
`-- registration.py  # DNS registry bindings
```

The initial `dns.lookup` tool runs `dig` inside a selected emulated container. It uses the node's
configured resolver by default or an explicitly supplied DNS server. The source container must have
the `dig` executable installed.

### BGP Domain

The BGP-domain skeleton lives under `tools/bgp/` and includes explicit argument and result models,
bound-method implementations, and registry bindings. Its reference tool is `bgp.summary`, which
runs `vtysh -c "show bgp ipv4 unicast summary"` inside a selected emulated router. The router
container must provide `vtysh` and a compatible routing daemon.

### PKI Domain

The PKI-domain skeleton lives under `tools/pki/` with the same domain-owned structure. Its reference
tool is `pki.inspect_certificate_file`, which uses `openssl x509` to inspect a certificate file
inside a selected emulated node. The source container must provide `openssl`, and the supplied path
is interpreted inside that container.
